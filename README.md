# buymyguitar
A 10-week web-dev project where I'll either have a job and a guitar, or just a guitar.

Day -1: A Plan begins to Form (14/10)
------------------------------------
Okay, so here's the backstory.
My girlfriend and I have been planning to move to London, but because of the Delta variant and a million and twelve other things going a bit wrong, we didn’t.
Now I’m still in my home country of New Zealand with a bunch of freed up savings,
but no job (since I had to quit in order to leave the country).

I’ve been eying up a guitar for a while.  Specifically, the Squier Classic Vibe 60’s Jazzmaster.  I tried it roughly 2 years ago and haven’t stopped thinking about it since.  I’ve been wanting to justify the purchase but it’s always been out of my disposable income’s price range, as well as my own skill level to be worth buying.
So, I’ve been using a miniature Stratocaster through a bass amp (and occasionally my friend’s practice amp) to teach myself guitar.
I think it’s time to upgrade.  There’s one Jazzmaster available, but I’ll need to spread the payments out over 10 weeks.  I quit my job just before we intended to go to London, so I’m currently unemployed.  But I’m feeling lucky (if not a bit stupid), and so this is my plan:
I’m going to start financing this guitar, and get hired somewhere before I finish paying it off.
But I only started a Compsci Diploma this year!  How will I demonstrate to employers that I have the skills to be a worthy asset on their team?
Over the next 10 weeks, I’m going to build as many projects as I can.  I have basic skills in a bunch of languages/workflows, but I never had any intrinsic reason to put them to the test (outside of passing my uni courses).  This seems like an incredibly stupid way to do extra curricular work, but I have a good feeling about it.
I’m going to spend the first day planning (and completing some assignments), then I’m going to set the timer off and buy myself a guitar and an amplifier, and we’ll see how we go from there.
